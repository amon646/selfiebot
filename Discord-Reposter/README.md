# Discord Reposter
A simple bot I made because I wanted my friends to stop deleting their messages.

It reposts all the messages from one channel to another, which can even be in another server!

However, the bot needs to be in both servers for this to work.

## Commands
### Repost To
*Reposts to a channel.*

`/repost <CHANNEL>` or `/repost to <CHANNEL>`

### Repost From
*Reposts from a channel.*

`/repost from <CHANNEL>`

*Reposts through a webhook.*

`/reposthook` or `/repostwebhook` instead of `/repost`
